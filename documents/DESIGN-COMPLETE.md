## 🔍 What Makes This Foolproof

### 1. Test-First Mandate

**Every feature:**
- ❌ Cannot write code without failing test first
- ✅ Write test → See it fail → Make it pass → Refactor

### 2. Contract Testing

**Every interface:**
- Has a contract test suite
- All implementations must pass contracts
- Ensures consistent behavior

```typescript
// Example
testGitRepositoryDetectorContract(() => new GitDetector());
testGitRepositoryDetectorContract(() => new GitDetectorV2());
// Both must pass same tests
```

### 3. Safety Test Coverage

**100% coverage for critical features:**
- Boundary validation
- Backup operations
- Restore operations
- Protected file checking
- Build validation

### 4. Test Builders

**Fluent API for test data:**

```typescript
const repo = await new TestRepoBuilder()
  .withType('monorepo')
  .withSubRepo('api', files)
  .withSubRepo('web', files)
  .build();
```

### 5. Mock Factories

**Centralized mock creation:**

```typescript
const mockAI = MockFactory.createAIProvider({
  analyzeFileAllocation: jest.fn()...
});
```

### 6. Integration Tests

**Test component interactions:**
- Distribution workflow
- Classification workflow
- Backup/restore workflow
- Build validation workflow

### 7. E2E Tests

**Test complete user flows:**
- Full cleanup workflow
- YOLO mode
- Interactive mode
- Restore scenarios

## 🎓 Key Principles to Follow

### During Implementation

1. **Never Write Code Without a Test**
   - Write failing test first
   - See it fail (RED)
   - Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor (REFACTOR)

2. **Keep Tests Clean**
   - Tests are first-class code
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Use test builders
   - Keep tests focused

3. **Maintain Coverage**
   - Check coverage after each feature
   - Never let it drop below 85%
   - 100% for safety features
   - No exceptions

4. **Use Contract Tests**
   - Every interface has contracts
   - All implementations must pass
   - Add new tests to contracts

5. **Mock Wisely**
   - Use mock factories
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Don't mock what you own
   - Keep mocks simple

6. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Empty inputs
   - Large inputs
   - Null/undefined
   - Permission errors
   - Network failures

7. **Verify Safety**
   - All 5 guarantees tested
   - 100% coverage
   - Test failure scenarios
   - Verify rollback
